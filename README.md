## Next Steps

###Overview
I want a very basic 

###Art
We're going to use this background for now </br>

We'll need some kind of grass / block too, for now. Most if not all of the game will take place at night, so I'm thinking some rando fireflies too? This can really just be yellow dots that fade in and out, but I think it'll add a nice touch. Also some trees or something for the background maybe? We'll leave these for last.

This is very roughly the kind of the "feel" I'm going for.

###Animation

For Midnight we'll need...

1. A jumping animation (this will really be 2 animations, one jumping into the air and the other landing)
2. An attack animation

We'll also need...
1. A Cat (her pet) and a running / trotting animation for him (do this last)
2. A basic enemy, and something for it to shoot

###Summary
To summarize

1. Nighttime grass tiles (static)
2. Maybe some trees for the background... maybe. (static)
3. Fireflies (animated)
4. Simply enemy that shoots something (simple animation)
5. A kitteh. (animated)
